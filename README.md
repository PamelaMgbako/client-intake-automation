 Automated Project Intake & Management System

This project outlines the creation of a fully automated workflow designed to streamline client intake, project management, and team communication.

## **Key Features:**

* **Automated Client Intake:** New client submissions from JotForm automatically trigger the creation of a unique project ID, a new task in Asana, and a corresponding record in Airtable.
* **Smart Reminders:** A scheduled Zap scans Airtable daily to find projects with upcoming deadlines and sends targeted Slack notifications to the team.
* **Real-time Analytics:** Key project data is automatically pushed to Google Sheets to provide a simple, real-time analytics dashboard.
* **Centralized Data:** Airtable acts as the central hub for all project information, while Asana and Slack handle task management and team communication, respectively.

## **Technology Stack:**

* **Zapier:** The core automation engine connecting all services.
* **Airtable:** For database management and automated logic.
* **Asana:** For task and project management.
* **Slack:** For real-time team notifications.
* **JotForm:** The initial trigger for client intake.
* **Google Sheets:** For project analytics and reporting.

This system saves time, improves project oversight, and ensures every detail is managed smoothly from start to finish.
